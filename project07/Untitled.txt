README 


To run this program just run the Main.Java function. 
This class is very simple just creates a instance of the Manager Class. 
When the constructor is called it starts the training function so the result should be 
sets of three numbers that should get really close the the desired output. 
When the training is done, the Console will provide the right info. 


Disclaimer: 
I have run into errors where I find that the values just become " NaN" 
I don't know where that's coming from, but it only happens 1 out of 20 times
